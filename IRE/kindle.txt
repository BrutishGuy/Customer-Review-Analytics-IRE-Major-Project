The only time I use my iPad is when I go to my mother's house, no wifi. I use this Kindle everyday. My ONLY complaint is that you cannot read it in the sun.

                 (u'I bought a Nook about 3 years ago because my sister worked for B&N..; I argued that I wanted a Kindle and then gave in... Ugh. My nook is alright, it\'s a 9" HD+ but besides a bigger screen and possibly better resolution this isn\'t much different-and way cheaper. My son has the 6" Kindle that he\'s had for two years and it\'s going strong. My best friend has gotten her daughter two Kindles in the few years past. For your money this is an amazing purchase. ESPECIALLY since I got this thing used!!! So far it\'s all good for me. I\'m basically checking e-mail, my son will play a game or two and I watch my Amazon Prime Video on this while cooking or doing the dishes to distract me from my motherly duties while I\'m in the kitchen-keeps me from having to put an annoying TV in there. This has Bluetooth and connects to WiFi. The Amazon store gives you a ton of popular apps so you won\'t be left out. I also enjoy using this as an e-reader, imagine that, a Kindle used for that!? Ha!! This was an amazing purchase for me to have something to fiddle with, I think it\'s under $50. You really can\'t go wrong.P.S. I did read some review about the sound quality being less than wonderful, I personally think it\'s okay-especially for less than $50, I don\'t turn it all the way up because with some lower quality speakers it seems to distort but I can fry foods run dishwater and still her my show just fine.',
