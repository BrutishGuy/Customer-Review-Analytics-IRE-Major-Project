{u'B011KFQASE': [(u'Outstanding deal.', u'5.0'), (u"I'm very, very happy with everything about this purchase.", u'5.0'), (u'Gave it as a Birthday gift!', u'5.0'), (u'I am not at all please with this lap top. It has been nothing but a pain in the neck to use.', u'2.0'), (u'My mother visited me recently and I got a first-hand look at her personal laptop. In short, it was a mess - buggy, full of viruses and prone to spontaneous crashes. I knew that she depended on her laptop to keep in touch with family and friends so something had to be done.A binge of researching led me to the ASUS F55LA. I ordered it with and additional 8 gigs of RAM as well as a Samsung 850 EVO 250GB solid state drive. Don\'t be deterred from upgrading the hard drive - the 850 EVO comes with the necessary software to clone the hard drive and it is pretty much idiot proof. The hardest part is opening up the machine to swap the drives and there are several videos online that walk you through the process.Seriously folks, enhancing this laptop with these upgrades makes it into a very capable machine. My \'daily driver\' is a 15" MacBook Pro and I felt very comfortable working with this laptop. It is fast, light and runs cool. The battery life is about 4 hours which is sufficient for a non-business user.The biggest drawback is the screen - it has very limited viewing angles. But once you find the \'sweet spot\' and crank the brightness to max it\'s not a bad viewing experience. Windows 10 is also not all that bad, and this is coming from an OSX fan. It will be perfect for Mom as it is very close to the Windows 7 she\'s used to. It even comes with Windows Defender, Microsoft\'s take on their own virus protection software.Bottom line, for $500 you can get a decent laptop. Highly recommended and I\'m sure it will be a hit with Mom. :)', u'4.0'), (u"I bought for my friend.BTW, It's a useful stuff for the working or studying.", u'4.0'), (u"I can't really do any review here because I just opened mine and plugged it in. Screen is just white. I need an exchange.", u'2.0'), (u"Bought mid-March in USA. The headphone jack appears to be defective, only working on the left channel, but it's too much hassle to return it as I live in Canada.Speakers sound good. Haven't checked out DVD player HDMI or 2 of the USB slots. otherwise works fine, though I haven't worked out how to make the print bigger on-screen.", u'4.0'), (u'I received my Asus laptop. It has a noise when you turn it around, as if a screw is loose, or piece of plastic.? I really dislike the idea of returning it. I need a computer to have cable turned on the 31st of March 2016.', u'3.0'), (u"Haven't had time to put a lot of hours on this computer, but so far, it is great.", u'5.0')], u'B015PYYDMQ': [(u"I got the laptop today and so far it's pretty amazing. It took all of about half an hour to get setup and up and running. I updated the drivers for the built in Intel video card and the Nvidia card right away for good measure. After uninstalling Mcafee the laptop was ready to go. I haven't had a chance to test it with any real games yet, but for everything else it's blazing fast. From completely turned off to on my desktop it takes about 8 seconds. If it's in hibernate mode and I open it up it takes about 1 second to get to my desktop. Also so far the battery life is phenomenal. I configured it around 4:45 this afternoon and messed around on it until 6 or so and the battery dropped to 90%. I closed the lid and went to dinner and came back a couple hours later and it was at 89%. Since using it the last few hours it's only dropped to 71%. Granted that's not doing any gaming or anything to intense, it's still great battery life overall. At this point there's nothing to complain about with this laptop. The screen is plenty bright, and I didn't notice any screen bleed like in some of the negative comments. I actually think the keyboard and trackpad work pretty well, not as good as a traditional mouse and keyboard, but much better than most people were leaving in reviews. Overall I couldn't recommend this laptop more to anyone looking for a moderately priced laptop that can get a lot of things done.", u'5.0'), (u'My friend likes it. Good performance with reasonable price.', u'5.0'), (u'Excellent', u'5.0'), (u'WIRELESS CAPABILITY IS VERY POOR', u'2.0'), (u"Quite well, that is, I don't know how to move the warranty to China Dell", u'5.0'), (u"I have owned this laptop for about a month now and I will post a follow up at about a half year.Pros:- Great Price. Can't beat the price on this laptop for what you get. Very decent graphics card that plays new games like The Division on low and older games on med/high- SSD. Can never go wrong with an SSD. I have all my games installed on here that I need faster load times or higher data stream rates. I installed a 1tb HD for files and other none essential storage.- Fan Noise. It gets decently loud when working at full speed trying to cool your graphics card, but it's nowhere near the sound of the old Dell I used to use.- Matte Finish. Kind of a personal thing but I love matte finish on laptops. Looks so much cleaner than gloss.Cons:- Wireless card. Very strange when a newer released laptop has a sub par wireless card. This thing gets 6 MB/s under my hardwired desktop and 5 MB/s under what my cell phone gets at an equal range. Kind of disappointing as the laptop main function for me is to use it for some couch gaming.- Mouse Pad. Very shoddy mouse pad, but like every other gamer out there I use an external mouse so it's not a huge issue. Can get a little annoying if I try to play some turn based games with my mouse pad.Overall:Giving it a 4 star review based mainly on the value of the laptop for the price. It is not a high end gaming machine and if you are considering buying this for that purpose than think again. You'll probably have to dip quite a bit further into your wallet for something like that. For my purpose, I love this thing and I'm glad I bought it. It's a bit of a shame about the wireless card, but if you have a high enough base internet speed it probably won't be noticable.", u'4.0'), (u"As far as reviews go, there are many others that would do a better job at analyzing all of the specs. I'm writing to give an update on the current laptop. I received ours today. All of the drivers that I tested (sound, video, mouse, etc.) are up to date, so that no longer seems to be an issue.I ran into one minor issue with the built-in mic. You need to set it up before it works. You can't just jump into Discord, Mumble, or whatever out of the box. There also seemed to be limited info on how to set it up. I expected it to be more obvious, coming from a Win7 machine. You need to go to Control Panel -> Sound -> Recording. Pick the Microphone, right click on it, and select Configure Speech Recognition. Pick Set Up Microphone, then Other at the bottom of the next window. Hit next a couple of times, read most of the prompt, and click next again to finish. You now have a working microphone, even if voice recognition doesn't interest you.", u'5.0'), (u'Amazing laptop for this price and with these specs, just make sure you update bios on the dell website and your good to go, i have not added any ssd or extra ram but ill do so in the future, it does have some dell bloat ware but nothing to much after that, the touch pad is horrible for gaming but yea you probably already know that just use a mouse or controller, does great with other non gaming and intensive programs like photo shop and auto cad, i really enjoy using this laptop, dell really hit a home run with this one.', u'5.0'), (u'I have spent the last few years with a HORRIBLE computer, so it is wonderful using a computer that actually works. Have only had for a few days but everything seems to be working great.', u'5.0'), (u"If you are looking through the reviews for this laptop you will find quite a few people saying they had certain problems with speaker quality until they turned off certain options or they had other minor software problems. I did have a few of those problems myself and if you get this you will probably have some similar issues getting it set up perfectly however if you are willing to spend the time and the google searches to overcome those minor issues this laptop is an incredible machine for the price. The processor and the SSD create an incredibly efficient machine when it comes to almost any task and the graphics card has handled every game I've thrown at it in beautiful high settings better than either console.(I swear I'm not a pc gaming elitist I just feel it is important to note if you are a new PC gamer to note that this will be on par or better than those consoles at most of the same games)If you are getting this for PC specific games such as MOBA's most of those are relatively simple to run and this played Heroes of the Storm and League of Legends on max settings at 60 frames no problem. As for MMO's I haven't actually tried any of those yet but my desktop handles those fairly well and this laptop is more powerful than it so it should be no problem.Basically if you are wiling to deal with some minor nuisances you really can't find another machine as good as this for under 1000. Really the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because someone not really tech savvy might struggle with it and I'm surprised they haven't updated or fixed some of these minor issues.", u'4.0')]}
